===

You can view detailed Trello Boards and export them to HTML (Save Page doesn't
work). An ideal use for this is to generate and print weekly/monthly reports (at

append a board id to the hash, for example, the report for the official Trello
Development is http://tianshuo.github.com/trello/#4d5ea62fd76aa1136000000c

The hosted version is on http://tianshuo.github.com/trello/ At the present moment,
only Chrome is supported. (I haven't tested firefox yet)
